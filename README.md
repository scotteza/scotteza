Hello! 😁

I'm Scott, an engineering manager and lead software engineer .

I work as a platform engineering manager for 4 teams (Developer Experience, Edge Compute, SRE, and Cloud Engineering) at [Cazoo](https://www.cazoo.co.uk/).

In my spare time I read books, play guitar, and learn about investing.
