Hello! 😁

I'm Scott, an engineering leader and all-round geek.

I am the Head of Platform Engineering at [Cazoo](https://www.cazoo.co.uk/), a role where I lead 4 teams (Developer Experience, Edge Compute, SRE, and Cloud Engineering).

In my spare time I read books, play guitar, garden, and learn about investing.
