Hello! 😁

I'm Scott, an engineering leader and all-round geek.

I am the platform engineering manager for 4 teams (Developer Experience, Edge Compute, SRE, and Cloud Engineering) at [Cazoo](https://www.cazoo.co.uk/).

In my spare time I read books, play guitar, garden, and learn about investing.

You can find my blog [here](https://scottedwards.tech/).
